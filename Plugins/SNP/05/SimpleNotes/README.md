Simple Notes Plugin
-------------------

This package introduces a simple note taking mechanism in Sublime Text 3,
allowing for the quick navigation and perusal of a notes file.

A note file is a file of type `note` which contains paragraphs of text marked
up with one or more `#hash_tags` that declare what that particular section of
the notes file is for.

Using the standard Sublime Text `Symbol List` you can quickly jump around
within a note file in order to find notes by topic. It is also possible to
automatically rearrange the contents of the file to bring all of the sections
for a tag to the top, consolidating them for easier reading.

The package also includes an auto-completion system which allows for the easy
completion of tags used elsewhere in the file as well as from a user
configurable list.

## About

The plugin in this package is inspired by my answer to [this question][1] on
Stack Overflow. The package itself was created over a series of videos on my
[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/nurdz), explaining the logic
behind the code and showing how to go from an idea to a (somewhat) complete
package.
