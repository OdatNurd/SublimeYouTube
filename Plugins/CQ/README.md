The videos in this series are for illustrating common questions that people
have while using Sublime Text, and cover a wide range of topics. Many of these
videos don't contain any direct sample files or resources purely due to the
nature of the videos themselves.

However, some videos do contain sample code or files that may be interesting to
play with and pull apart without having to go to all of the trouble of manually
typing them yourself. So, here we are!
