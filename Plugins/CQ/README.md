Common Questions
----------------

The videos in this series are for illustrating common questions that people
have while using Sublime Text, and cover a wide range of topics. Many of these
videos don't contain any direct sample files or resources purely due to the
nature of the videos themselves.

However, some videos do contain sample code or files that may be interesting to
play with and pull apart without having to go to all of the trouble of manually
typing them yourself. So, here we are!


* [08](08) \[[Video][8]]: This video shows the basics of a custom build system
  target in Sublime Text. This example just displays the arguments that would
  be passed to the target, to help visualize how the build command is executed.

* [10](10) \[[Video][10]]: This video shows a simple way to use a custom build
  `target` to run code and expand your own variables while still being able to
  execute the build normally.

* [11](11) \[[Video][11]]: This video extends the custom build target from the
  previous video so that it can be used in the `cancel` key of a build file to
  cancel a build without also prompting you to cancel the build.

* [12](12) \[[Video][12]]: This video shows a more advanced way to create a
  custom build `target` that allows you to detect when a build is finished or
  being cancelled. We can also now enable or disable the cancel command in the
  menu appropriately!

* [13](13) \[[Video][13]]: This video includes three custom build targets that
  show some real world examples of custom build targets. This shows how to
  temporarily disable showing build results and two methods for using the
  currently selected text in your build system.
