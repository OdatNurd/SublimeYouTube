OdatNurd's YouTube Sublime Setup
--------------------------------

This directory contains all of the custom Packages (not available via
[Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/)) that are used to configure the
copy of Sublime you see running in the videos on my
[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/nurdz), allowing you to see how
I've set things up. Since configurations are ever changing, what's here should
reflect the most recently recorded videos, assuming I've kept things up to date
properly.

The [User](User/) folder contains the settings, plugins and customizations to
Sublime that I tend to use. If you see something in the video and it doesn't
seem to look or work the way your copy of Sublime does, chances are good the
reason is something stored in this folder (unless it's one of my top secret
Sublime related Screencasting plugins, and then it's not).

Possibly the biggest point of interest may be the
[Package Control.sublime-settings](User/Package%20Control.sublime-settings)
configuration file, which will give you an indication of what Sublime Text
packages I have installed other than those you see here.
