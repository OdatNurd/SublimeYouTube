OdatNurd's YouTube Source Repository
------------------------------------

Hello and welcome fellow Sublime Text Fanatics!

This repository is related to the Sublime Text 3 videos that are available
***right now*** for your viewing pleasure on my
[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/nurdz). Haven't seen them yet?
No worries, you can go ahead and jump over and watch some of them to see what
you've been missing. No time like the present!

The first thing to mention is that contained here is the
[User package](Packages/User/) that is used throughout the videos, allowing you
to see exactly how I've set things up, what packages I'm using and all of that
other cool stuff.

Of course I would ***never*** advocate just blindly copying code from somewhere
as a learning tool, because practice makes perfect and what better way to
practice than to, you know, practice?

However, sometimes we're in a hurry to get to the local Tim Horton's for that
first morning coffee or we need to press our faces longingly up against the
window at the Krispy Kreme and wish our bodies hadn't betrayed us and we could
eat that delicious mountain of donuts going past on the conveyor belt.

Time being the fleeting commodity that it is, perhaps you have a desire to have
a copy of working code right there in your copy of Sublime so that you can play
with changing it, or things ***just*** don't seem to be doing what you think
they should and you'd like to compare against a working version to see what is
different.

Fear not! The repository also contains those very reference materials, handily
laid out by video. Coffee and Donut lovers rejoice!

It's also work noting that some of the videos may reference code that is taken
directly from the
[SublimeScraps](https://github.com/STealthy-and-haSTy/SublimeScraps)
repository where [Keith Hall](https://github.com/keith-hall) and
[myself](https://github.com/OdatNurd) maintain a list of useful Sublime Text
snippets and examples that we've written for ourselves or others.

So, you won't find that code here, but you can **totally** find it in that
repository, so all is not lost!

What are you waiting for? Lets
[get cracking](https://www.youtube.com/user/nurdz)!
